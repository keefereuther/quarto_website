    "text": "GNU General Public License v3.0 Copyright (c) 2024 Keefe Reuther\n                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nUse with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w' andshow c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html."

    "section": "Figuring it out by messing it all up",
    "text": "Figuring it out by messing it all up\nIn my third year at UCSD, I was thrilled to have found a professor who 1) embodied my interest in merging science and writing and 2) had genuine enthusiasm in my professional development. With the right program, he encouraged me that he would be able to support my independent research ventures. The TRELS program at UCSD was the perfect platform for me to both explore the communication of climate change and completely botch my mentorship with a professor.\nAlthough this was not my intention, the experience taught me an important lesson that I wished I understood earlier during my time at UCSD.\nHow exactly did I achieve this? The Triton Research & Experiential Learning Scholars (TRELS) program was the first platform I had been granted to express and develop my academic interests with a professor. I immediately poured all parts of myself into this project and, in doing so, asked too much of my mentor.\nI wanted to explore human language, to understand how the structure of words in a sentence could have an impact on how we perceive and make decisions about climate change. I wished to investigate decades of discussions surrounding global warming and how this history perpetuates misinformation we still see today. I sought to labor through dense climate reports and reference the well researched biology, chemistry, and physics that already existed.\nAnd beyond my research paper, I had an innate desire to understand who exactly I was becoming in my journey of personal and professional development. While I rejected it at the time, my identity was intricately woven between my interests.\nIt was only after I told this story to another professor of mine did the reality of my “plan” of mentorship come crashing down. No one person would be able to appeal to all the facets of my interests and needs in my academic development. I needed a linguist, a historian, and a climate scientist at least to aid me in my research goals , and instead, I had brought these expectations into my mentorship with a single professor.\n\nI’ll admit I’m being a little hard on my third-year self, as the pursuit for mentorship is self-motivated on a large public campus such as UCSD.\nUniversity is many students’ first opportunity to dictate their education. Many students are coming from high school where education is driven by obligation, and most classes, teachers, and times of instruction are assigned with little student input. Upon entering UCSD, I found myself in control of my chosen degree with the exception of a few administrative nudges in the right direction in order to graduate on time. The void of academic constraint was suddenly overflowing with choices I had to make, and after planning out the first few quarters at UCSD, I was satiated with my own involvement in my undergraduate degree. Directing my own mentorship, which would include the close involvement of PhD-holding professors, was completely absent from my mind.\n\nHowever, as I became more comfortable with the campus, I realized that there was an unavoidably large piece of my education missing - mentorship.\nBy my third year, when I had finally found a professor who acknowledged my interests as something worth investing in, I didn’t know how to ask for what I needed. After months of searching for a professor to represent me and my academic growth, I came into my mentorship starstruck and unable to use critical thinking. I was looking for too much guidance in too many places, all the while not really knowing what I was looking for.\nLuckily, upon reflection, this problem has a dynamic solution."

    "title": "Why You Need Mosaic Mentorship",
    "section": "Mosaic mentorship",
    "text": "Mosaic mentorship\nWhat I needed in the past was a community of mentors full of niche, yet separate, roles in my progression of research and sense of self as an academic. While relatively new, the concept of community or “mosaic” mentorship, or the incorporation of an array of diverse mentors into a student’s professional growth, has been thought to better aid mentees (Khatchikian, Chahal, and Kielar, 2021).\nI was able to experience the benefits of mosaic mentorship firsthand, as I incorporated a community of mentors into my master’s program. A master’s in biology at UCSD includes performing two years of lab research under the guidance of a Principal Investigator (PI) and synthesizing your findings into a written and oral thesis. In addition to your PI, you need at least two more UCSD professionals or thesis committee members in order to complete your master’s. While my PI aided me in my direct research, my committee members gave me a wide perspective of the field and how to effectively communicate science.\nAdditionally, having two, three, four perspectives on a collection of topics allowed me to critically think about my lab PI’s advice and guidance.\n\nWhile a professor’s opinion may be trying to steer you in the right direction for their profession, this may not actually be where you are wanting to take your development. Rather than become a parrot of your mentor’s advice, with mosaic mentorship you are able to synthesize collective thought to become the researcher you are aiming to be.\nMosaic mentorship also benefits your mentor too. All professors at UCSD do work outside of the classroom and most likely cannot offer you the complete mentorship you are looking for, even if they are enthusiastic about working with you. Mosaic mentorship respects the time of your mentors by dividing up the amount of mentorship you need to succeed.\nMentorship completely enlivened my experience at UCSD. Learning facts about biology was what I came to UCSD to do, but becoming scientifically literate and fostering my own sense of professional identity was the most important part of the process. And this is not only true for me– it has been shown that students mentored in academia tended to self-identify as a scientist more than those without a mentor (Atkins et al., 2020). It is difficult to feel a part of the academic community without a group of people there to champion and advocate for you.\nUniversity is a place to find inspiration for your academic goals, but it is ultimately up to you to invest in your interests. I was never taught how to effectively pursue mentorship, and it took a few mistakes to finalize what I needed. You will most likely continue to make mistakes along your mentorship journey, but I can assure you that it will be worth it."

I encourage you to embrace it, but use it wisely and ethically.\nPhilosophical Overview\nGenerative AI is neutral by nature, neither good nor bad. Its value hinges on how it’s applied. We acknowledge AI’s potential to both elevate and diminish the academic experience. While it’s a powerful tool for the digital age and essential for our future, it doesn’t absolve us from upholding academic integrity and opposing plagiarism.\nPersonal Responsibility and Accountability\nYou own your work. AI can assist, but it shouldn’t be the main contributor. If your work appears overly dependent on AI, expect an oral quiz to test your understanding. Remember: mastering AI, like any skill, takes effort. Over-relying on it shortchanges your education and has lasting consequences.\n\nAttribution and Documentation\nUsing AI-generated content? Document:\n\nPrompts given to the AI: “&lt;List prompt(s)&gt;”\nAI’s direct output: “”\nYour modifications to the output: “”\nHow did you verify the information? Did you run the code or did you have to fact-check online?\n\nInclude this documentation in your references/citations. It won’t impact word or page limits.\nExample:\n\nPrompt for ChatGPT: “Discuss the impact of climate change on marine biodiversity.”\nAI’s output: “Climate change has led to ocean acidification, causing coral bleaching and marine species decline.”\nMy modifications: Added recent stats and specific species examples and I fact-checked the gen AI claims at: How does climate change affect coral reefs?\n\n\nDisclaimer on Generative AI\nGenerative AI, such as ChatGPT, can sometimes produce misleading or false information. You’re accountable for every submission, AI-assisted or not. ALWAYS fact-check AI-generated content before submission."

    "section": "",
    "text": "SABER West Conference 2024\n\nIn contemporary educational settings, grading equity remains a significant challenge, with first-generation and minoritized students of color often facing systemic disparities. This poster presents a novel approach utilizing machine learning to identify and optimize syllabus policies that minimize grading inequity. The research focuses on developing intentional grading policies that can be easily amended to effectively reduce grading differences. The study begins with the premise that while many factors contribute to the equity gap in grading, optimizable grading policies play a crucial role. These policies, including assessment weightings, late policies, dropped assignments, and minimum scores, often lack evidence-based best practices.\nThis research aims to establish a more data-driven approach to these policies using a differential evolution machine learning model. Differential evolution is an optimization algorithm that iteratively improves candidate solutions regarding a quality measure, inspired by natural evolution. The objective was to minimize the median grade difference between minoritized and non-minoritized students by optimizing the weight of assignment groups. The data came from an ecology and evolution course at an R1 university with over 300 students.\nThe optimized grading policies decreased the median grade difference from 5.79% to 3.07%. This highlights the potential of machine learning as a tool to address systemic inequities in education. The model will be tested on new datasets from real courses. Future study can determine evidence-based best practices for more equitable grading policies and explore implementing optimized policies in active classrooms. I am actively looking for collaborators that have experience using machine learning techniques in research as well as instructors interested in using this approach in the classroom."

    "section": "",
    "text": "SABER West Conference 2023\n\nGruber, Maxwell A., Tsai, Randy G., Mel, Stephanie F., Reuther, Keefe D., and Lo, Stanley M. University of California, San Diego\nCourse-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) serve as innovative avenues for increasing accessibility of early research experience to a larger number of students, including underrepresented minority students. Previously, we reported the implementation of a large-enrollment introductory in-person CURE on soil microbiomes (Lo 2017; Lo 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the shift to remote learning, where hands-on experience in physical laboratories ceased. In an effort to address the lack of hands-on lab experience, we created and distributed lab kits that allowed students to complete about half of the hands-on experiments that were previously present in the in-person CURE.\nIn this study, we describe student outcomes on self-efficacy on research skills from 3 course modalities: in-person CURE (n=596), remote CURE without lab kits (n=201), and remote CURE with lab kits (n=696). Student outcomes were measured pre- and post-course using a modified version of the classroom undergraduate research experience survey (Denofrio 2007; Mordacq 2017). We hypothesized students would report decreases in self-efficacy on research skills in the remote CUREs compared to the in-person CURE. We also hypothesized students in the remote CURE with lab kits would report gains in self-efficacy on research skills compared to the remote CURE without lab kits.\nOne-way ANOVA analyses showed that students in the remote CURE without lab kits reported significant self-efficacy gains in 10 out of 21 items compared to the in-person CURE. Students in the remote CURE with lab kits reported significant gains in 3 additional items: carrying out a project entirely designed by students (81.1% increase, p&lt;0.0001), analyzing research data (60.8% increase, p&lt;0.0001), and writing a research proposal (56.6% increase, p&lt;0.0001). The data suggest that remote CUREs with lab kits may provide an avenue to positively enhance the development of research skills in undergraduate students enrolled in remote learning programs."

    "text": "SABER West Conference 2024\n\nSince the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, generative AI has rapidly entered the college classroom. New capabilities are continually emerging that impact teaching and learning environments. In higher education broadly, there has been an influx of conferences, preprints, publications, and working groups examining implications and applications of generative AI. However, there is a need to specifically examine the role of generative AI within undergraduate biology education. The unique challenges and potential solutions in biology classrooms likely differ from other disciplines like creative writing or computer science. To explore this, I have developed a survey to distribute at SABER 2024. This survey has three aims: 1) Build a community of DBER scholars investigating generative AI applications in undergraduate biology. 2) Identify priorities for professional development on generative AI, for both SABER members and their home institutions. 3) Gather instructor and student perspectives on how generative AI is impacting teaching and learning of biology. I have drafted this survey and welcome feedback from the SABER community to improve it before implementation in the summer of 2024. Beyond gathering data, I hope this survey connects those interested in creatively harnessing the potential of generative AI in this new landscape we find ourselves in."

    "section": "",
    "text": "SABER West Conference 2023\n\nLiam O. Mueller, Keefe Reuther University of California, San Diego\nGiven the short timeframe of the college course, it can be difficult to have students generate an experimental design, collect data, and analyze those data in 10-16 weeks (unless the class is built around that goal). Work arounds for many classes have included giving students an experimental design, or having the analysis pre-described (everyone in the class does the exact same statistical test). However, until now, there has not been an easy way for instructors to forgo the data collection step, and still get randomized, unique, lifelike data sets. Here we present and offer you an opportunity to test a new R based tool that gives students unique, lifelike, computer synthesized datasets and instructors individualized grading keys that address the following issues common in coursework projects:\n\nEach student has their own unique data, removing the necessity of group work that live data collection often brings. Issues of students not contributing to group analysis and academic integrity are reduced/removed when each student has a never-before-seen data set. Having the ability to asses each student’s individual statistical ability is important for building strong STEM graduates (How do you split up the work of running a t-test anyway?).\nGiven the data is computer generated, the instructor is in control of the success of the study. Parameters in the R package can adjust the coefficient of interest (r, t, b, etc.) and the type II error rate (β) of the data, meaning that each student’s data can be guaranteed to have a p- value lower than α. Or, if the goal of the project is to have students make difficult decisions about what their conclusions should be, the power of the synthetic data can be lowered.\nDeviations from the assumptions of a statistical test, especially deviations from normality, can be difficult to determine in natural data. With synthesized data, instructors can set very specific data issues like skew, kurtosis, and outliers. Having a known problem with the data also makes assessment easier on graders, who themselves might not have the statistical acumen to grade challenging data decisions.\nIn classes that use real data, instructors must put in considerable time in developing grading keys for IAs. This R package will automatically generate grading keys for instructors."

    "text": "Link the to CourseSource paper\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a need to convert in-person laboratory courses into an online format in a short amount of time. For this reason, we converted our face-to-face molecular biology lab course to an online version in Spring 2020. The lab course focuses on using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to introduce mutations into the ADE2 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When planning the conversion to online, we identified a number of challenges to addressing the course goals, such as including technology, accessing real data for analysis, and engaging students in collaboration. After brainstorming ways to address these and other challenges, we developed an online lab course for which the “in lab” portion was largely focused on working collaboratively on data analysis, troubleshooting, and drawing conclusions, as well as experimental design and examining primary literature. Surveys suggest students perceived significant gains in key scientific thinking and process skills including forming scientific arguments, data analysis, and working collaboratively. Students also reported multiple different ways in which the online courses made them feel like scientists. Here we describe key parts of the course structure and our experience in teaching the course to over 200 students. We also describe the process of converting from face-to-face to online, as the process could be applied to any existing hands-on lab. The process enabled us to quickly adapt important information, course goals, and experimental contexts from existing labs, reducing the workload involved in creating a new lab while still providing the experience of focusing on scientific thinking skills to students."

Students learn by participating in a research project that may use their collected and analyzed data to address a question important to the larger scientific community. This may include contributing to peer-reviewed publications, white papers, online databases, etc. Students can claim ownership of a legitimate scientific product, thereby helping them gain confidence in their identity as a scientist.\nHowever, CURE data is often problematic. Students by nature are novices, making data quality a serious issue. Additionally, sampling is often structured to fit into a quarterly or semester schedule, repeated throughout the year, which potentially leads to significant pseudoreplication and diminished statistical power. Most importantly, the primary goals of teaching and experimentation are different and sometime challenging to align.\nOur research uses data collected from CUREs run in undergraduate lab courses to test various methods to address these issues. Currently, we are drafting best practices for data validation and the handling of missing and outlier data."

The free 3.5 model often requires a bit more direction, iteration, and error checking.\nClaudeAI is a free option that is getting increasingly impressive for a free service. I find it works well for this project.\n\n\n\nUsing the Prompt:\n\nCopy and paste one of the prompts provided below to the generative AI platform of your choice.\n\n\n\nOption 1: You already have questions\nOption 1 is if you already have assessment questions and need them formatted for upload to Canvas. Copy and paste (and edit as needed) the prompt below into a gen AI chat.\n\n\nOPTION 1 PROMPT\n\nI have questions that I need properly formatted according to the style guide outlined in this prompt. \nMy questions will include the following question types:\n  - multiple choice questions\n  - multiple answer questions\n  - applied or conceptual essay questions \n\nEach question carries a point value of 1. \n\nYour first response should request my drafted quiz questions. You will only modify the formatting as required. Do NOT change the wording of the questions I provide.\n\nQuestions must follow the style guide provided:\n\n1. Use format encapsulated within a code block.\n2. Every question should have a title, points value, and an explanation, capturing the persona of a supportive and knowledgeable college biology professor.\n3. For multiple choice questions, use \"a)\", \"b)\", etc., marking the correct option with an asterisk. Randomly vary which option is correct. It should not always be choice \"a)\"\n4. For multiple answer questions, use \"[ ]\" for options and \"[*]\" for correct answers.\n5. Essay questions should end with a new line that includes \"_________\". See examples below.\n6. Begin every feedback with three dots\n7. Questions should only be separated by a line break. Do not add in any extraneous formatting such as \"---\" between questions.\n\nThe quiz's first question should always uphold academic integrity, as shown in the example below.\n\n Example format in (generate your response entirely within a code block):\n\nQuiz title: Learning Laboratory Techniques: DNA Extraction, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis\nQuiz description: Review your understanding of DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis.\n\nTitle: Learn with integrity\nPoints: 1\n1. I agree to complete this quiz without the aid of others or AI. I agree not to discuss questions and answers of the quiz until the quiz key is posted. Anything otherwise is a breach of my Academic Integrity and subject to the policies of the University.\n*a) I agree\nb) I disagree\n\nTitle: PCR - Mechanism and Reagents\nPoints: 1\n2. Which of the following describes the mechanism of PCR?\n... PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a method used to amplify specific segments of DNA. It relies on a cycle of denaturation, annealing, and extension. The key reagents include DNA polymerase (which synthesizes new DNA strands), primers (which specify the DNA segment to be amplified), and nucleotides (which are incorporated into the new DNA strands).\na) PCR breaks down proteins.\nb) PCR translates mRNA into protein.\n*c) PCR amplifies specific DNA segments.\nd) PCR transcribes DNA into RNA.\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Expected Results and Troubleshooting\nPoints: 1\n3. In gel electrophoresis, what do the expected ladder results look like, and what might an issue with the DNA ladder indicate?\n... Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size. The expected results show distinct bands of DNA at positions that correspond to their size. The DNA ladder serves as a size marker. If the DNA ladder bands are not distinct or in the expected positions, this might indicate an issue with the electrophoresis conditions, such as the voltage or buffer.\n*a) Expected results show distinct bands of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the electrophoresis conditions.\nb) Expected results show a single band of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the PCR reaction.\nc) Expected results show a gradient of color; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the staining process.\nd) Expected results show no visible bands; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the DNA extraction.\n\nTitle: DNA - Structure and Replication\nPoints: 1\n4. What aspect of DNA is crucial for its replication in PCR and why?\n... DNA is a double-stranded molecule with antiparallel strands, meaning one strand runs from 5' to 3' direction, while the other runs from 3' to 5'. This antiparallel structure is essential for DNA replication because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand, and the process of replication requires a complimentary strand to serve as a template.\n*a) The antiparallel double-stranded structure is crucial because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end.\nb) The helical structure is crucial because it allows the DNA to be unwound for replication by enzymes.\nc) The presence of histone proteins is crucial because they help to package the new DNA strands.\nd) The sequence of the nucleotides is crucial because it determines how negatively charged the DNA is.\n\nTitle: DNA - Complimentary Base Pairing\nPoints: 1\n5. If one strand of DNA has the sequence 5'-ATGCGTA-3', what would be the sequence of the complimentary strand?\n... In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Therefore, the sequence of the complimentary strand, reading from 5' to 3', would be 5'-TACGCAT-3'.\na) 3'-TACGCAT-5'\nb) 5'-ATGCGTA-3'\n*c) 5'-TACGCAT-3'\nd) 5'-CATGCGT-3'\n\nTitle: PCR - Expected Results\nPoints: 1\n6.

Copy and paste (and edit as needed) the prompt below into a gen AI chat.\n\n\nOPTION 2 PROMPT\n\nDesign a compelling online quiz tailored for an undergraduate biology course, emphasizing higher-order cognitive skills based on Bloom's taxonomy. The quiz should comprise:\n- 10 multiple choice questions\n- 10 multiple answer questions\n- 5 applied or conceptual essay questions \n\nEach question carries a point value of 1. Ensure questions are not based on mere factual recall. Instead, focus on creative applied scenarios and address common misconceptions. Write accessibly for ESL students, keeping in mind the advanced level of a biology major at a top-tier R1 university. \n\nYour first response should request a list of topics from me in the form of a list.\n\nQuestions must follow the style guide provided:\n\n1. Use format encapsulated within a code block.\n2. Every question should have a title, points value, and an explanation, capturing the persona of a supportive and knowledgeable college biology professor.\n3. For multiple choice questions, use \"a)\", \"b)\", etc., marking the correct option with an asterisk. Randomly vary which option is correct. It should not always be choice \"a)\"\n4. For multiple answer questions, use \"[ ]\" for options and \"[*]\" for correct answers.\n5. Essay questions should end with a new line that includes \"_________\". See examples below.\n6. Begin every feedback with three dots\n7. Questions should only be separated by a line break. Do not add in any extraneous formatting such as \"---\" between questions.\n\nThe quiz's first question should always uphold academic integrity, as shown in the example below.\n\n\nExample format in (generate your response entirely within a code block):\n\nQuiz title: Learning Laboratory Techniques: DNA Extraction, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis\nQuiz description: Review your understanding of DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis.\n\nTitle: Learn with integrity\nPoints: 1\n1. I agree to complete this quiz without the aid of others or AI. I agree not to discuss questions and answers of the quiz until the quiz key is posted. Anything otherwise is a breach of my Academic Integrity and subject to the policies of the University.\n*a) I agree\nb) I disagree\n\nTitle: PCR - Mechanism and Reagents\nPoints: 1\n2. Which of the following describes the mechanism of PCR?\n... PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a method used to amplify specific segments of DNA. It relies on a cycle of denaturation, annealing, and extension. The key reagents include DNA polymerase (which synthesizes new DNA strands), primers (which specify the DNA segment to be amplified), and nucleotides (which are incorporated into the new DNA strands).\na) PCR breaks down proteins.\nb) PCR translates mRNA into protein.\n*c) PCR amplifies specific DNA segments.\nd) PCR transcribes DNA into RNA.\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Expected Results and Troubleshooting\nPoints: 1\n3. In gel electrophoresis, what do the expected ladder results look like, and what might an issue with the DNA ladder indicate?\n... Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size. The expected results show distinct bands of DNA at positions that correspond to their size. The DNA ladder serves as a size marker. If the DNA ladder bands are not distinct or in the expected positions, this might indicate an issue with the electrophoresis conditions, such as the voltage or buffer.\n*a) Expected results show distinct bands of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the electrophoresis conditions.\nb) Expected results show a single band of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the PCR reaction.\nc) Expected results show a gradient of color; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the staining process.\nd) Expected results show no visible bands; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the DNA extraction.\n\nTitle: DNA - Structure and Replication\nPoints: 1\n4. What aspect of DNA is crucial for its replication in PCR and why?\n... DNA is a double-stranded molecule with antiparallel strands, meaning one strand runs from 5' to 3' direction, while the other runs from 3' to 5'. This antiparallel structure is essential for DNA replication because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand, and the process of replication requires a complimentary strand to serve as a template.\n*a) The antiparallel double-stranded structure is crucial because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end.\nb) The helical structure is crucial because it allows the DNA to be unwound for replication by enzymes.\nc) The presence of histone proteins is crucial because they help to package the new DNA strands.\nd) The sequence of the nucleotides is crucial because it determines how negatively charged the DNA is.\n\nTitle: DNA - Complimentary Base Pairing\nPoints: 1\n5. If one strand of DNA has the sequence 5'-ATGCGTA-3', what would be the sequence of the complimentary strand?\n... In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C).

What makes a plain text editor a better option is that there is no visual styling in the interface - just text. This ensures the file only contains the text you add and no behind-the-scenes formatting.\nUse the style guide found here (the more detailed option). You may also check out the example style I have created below (the simpler option)\n\n\nOPTION 3 STYLE GUIDE\n\n    Questions must follow the style guide provided:\n\n1.

Evaluating the context and underlying assumptions is crucial in minimizing bias.\nExample of a Vague Scientific Question: How effective is the Pfizer vaccine?\n\nWho? Are we talking about a specific age group, sex, health history? Be specific about the group you want to learn about.\nWhat? Clarify what “effective” means in this context. Are we talking about preventing any infection, any symptoms, or preventing hospitalization or death?\nWhere? Choose the location for your study carefully. A study in one country may not be easily generalizable to another.\nWhen? When will the data be collected and how often will individuals be tested? Are we collecting short or long-term health data? Might data be collected at a time when a particularly nasty COVID variant is prevalent?\nHow? How will you collect data? Will you use questionnaires or will you test subjects for COVID? Each method has its own errors and biases\nWhy? What is your reason for conducting your experiment? Are people’s lives at stake?

Will you be able to test ALL adults over the age of 16? No, you might be able to test as many as 50,000, but that is just a subset of the group you are asking about.\n\nYour question addresses a broader group, but your experiment will only measure a sample of it. This means there are two potential answers:\n\nThe effect that exists in reality for the entire group of interest.\nThe effect observed in your data collected from your sample.\n\nYou aim for these answers to be the same, but discrepancies can occur, and that’s not necessarily your fault."

    "text": "Part 3: How uncertain are we in our results?\nAfter running your experiment and collecting data, it’s important to evaluate the likelihood of inaccuracies.\n\n\n\nTable of Possibilities in Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nAs a researcher, you are hoping your results match reality (true positive or negative). Through good design and analysis, you hope to minimize and measure the probability your results are different from reality (false positive or negative).\n\nUnderstanding False Positives and magical, mysterious P-value:\nTake your two types of hypotheses:\n\nAlternate hypotheses: There is an effect! Vaccine is more effective than placebo.\nNull hypothesis: There is NO effect. Vaccines are equal in efficacy with placebo.\n\nAssuming the null hypothesis is true, the p-value is the probability that you could have gotten your results or something more extremely different by chance. The lower this probability is, the more likely your results represent a true positive (i.e. significantly different experimental groups).\n\nFor example, let’s say you have a perfectly fair coin (i.e. the null hypothesis is true and the probability of flipping heads or tails is the same). You flip the coin 10 times and get 2 heads. Doesn’t sound like a fair coin, but what is the probability of flipping 2 heads by chance with a fair coin? About 4.4%. The p value would be the probability of flipping two heads or something more extreme. This would be the sum of the probabilities of flipping 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, and 10 heads, which happens to be ~11% or a p value = 0.11.\n\nYet another way to think about p-values: Let’s say you run your experiment and have a p-value of 0.05. YAY! It’s a significant difference and I won science and all my grants will get funded! Well…maybe. Once again, let’s assume the null is actually true. And imagine you ran your exact same experiment 100 different times. In 5 of those experiments, by random chance, you would think there is a difference but there really isn’t. How do you know whether your results are part of that rare 5% and your positive results are a random fluke? You don’t. Only replication and higher sample size might help you better figure that out.\nSo why is 0.05 the magical p-value number of significance? No particularly specific reason. Historically it was recommended by R. Fisher in 1925 out of convenience. Everything had to be calculated by hand at that time anyway.\nThis threshold is called the alpha value and the researcher should set it based on the amount of risk they are willing to assume if the results are a false positive. That is why the significance threshold should be as low as 0.01 or 0.0001 if you’re testing the safety of a medicine that could possibly result in death.\n\n\nWhat about false negatives? Aren’t they powerfully important too?\nP-values don’t directly tell us anything about the power of an analysis, which is the ability of our experiment to see an effect that is actually present.\nStatistical power = 1 - the probability of a false negative.\nGood power is often thought to be around .80. This means that if an effect is present, your data analysis will see it 80% of the time. Unfortunately, much of the research published today has much lower power AND it’s often not reported in articles. Isn’t this awful? Tell me about it! Change the system and speak truth to power."

This is often measured by a statistic called Cohen’s D or Glass’ Delta. It’s also not reported as often as it should be.\nWell that doesn’t sound right. What should I do? It’s good to report all relevant statistics: p-value, power, sample size, and effect size. In fact, these are things you should incorporate as early as the design phase of your experiment:\n\nDetermine the effect size you’d like to be able to see in your experiment. Sometimes you don’t need to be able to tell if the difference between groups is 0.001%.\nDetermine the power and p-value thresholds you are comfortable with BEFORE you collect all your data.\nDecide on the appropriate statistical test(s) you’ll use to test your hypothesis.\nUse a power analysis to estimate the sample size needed to be able to see a given effect at your proposed power.\nRun your experiment with that sample size and calculate the actual (i.e. post-hoc) measures of power, effect size, and p-value.

    "text": "SABER West Conference 2024\n\nSince the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, generative AI has rapidly entered the college classroom. New capabilities are continually emerging that impact teaching and learning environments. In higher education broadly, there has been an influx of conferences, preprints, publications, and working groups examining implications and applications of generative AI. However, there is a need to specifically examine the role of generative AI within undergraduate biology education. The unique challenges and potential solutions in biology classrooms likely differ from other disciplines like creative writing or computer science. To explore this, I have developed a survey to distribute at SABER 2024. This survey has three aims: 1) Build a community of DBER scholars investigating generative AI applications in undergraduate biology. 2) Identify priorities for professional development on generative AI, for both SABER members and their home institutions. 3) Gather instructor and student perspectives on how generative AI is impacting teaching and learning of biology. I have drafted this survey and welcome feedback from the SABER community to improve it before implementation in the summer of 2024. Beyond gathering data, I hope this survey connects those interested in creatively harnessing the potential of generative AI in this new landscape we find ourselves in.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{2024,\n  author = {},\n  title = {Gathering {Perspectives} on {Generative} {AI} in\n    {Undergraduate} {Biology} {Education}},\n  date = {2024-01-13},\n  url = {https://reutherlab.netlify.app/docs/blog/posts/saberwestsurvey/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\n“Gathering Perspectives on Generative AI in Undergraduate Biology\nEducation.” 2024.

    "text": "Incorporating a Mentorship Plan into Your Degree\nIt wasn’t until halfway through my master’s program at UC San Diego did I realize I needed to create an adaptive mentorship plan. In order to graduate and feel confident going into the working world outside of my master’s, I needed to receive extra support. \nI was in the expedited BS/MS program, which combined a year’s worth of research at a lab on campus in my BS with another year’s worth of research in my MS. Because it was a degree in biology, this meant that my research would culminate in a final written and oral thesis defense. \nI had comfortably stayed at my undergraduate lab for my master’s, and while my location did not change, the expectation for my work had. \nThe next year of my master’s was going to be rigorous, as my experiments were longer and required more attention, and I was a bit terrified to present my research among academics. My postdoctoral mentor had also recently left the lab and with that my primary person for direct technical guidance and career advice was no longer as easily accessible. \nIt was hard to admit at the time, but I was treading in deep, deep water. I was unsure how to navigate this all with less support than I had before. \n\nBecause of my experiences with mentorship in the past, I recognized that I needed extended support and some clarity within the mentorship I already had.\n\nIf you are asked to tackle larger responsibilities and your abilities are stretched thin, your support system will need to step up.\nAnd because everyone is busy and has many responsibilities of their own, the only person that can catalyze this is you. Rather than expend your energy trying to cover all your bases, an investment into a mentorship plan will help tremendously. \n\n\nHow does one successfully create a mentorship plan?\nFirstly, it is important to differentiate a research plan from a mentorship plan. Similar to many other research-based MS programs, I submitted a research proposal during my application process. A research proposal outlines what types of experiments you will be conducting in order to answer a set of scientific questions, and how you might achieve these goals throughout your academic timeline. While it is easy for you to think your research proposal encompasses your mentorship plan, this is not the case. \nA mentorship plan recognizes the mentors that you currently have (professors, postdocs, TAs, peers etc) and what they are capable of assisting you with. From there, you may notice the gaps of support where you need it most. Much of my own anxiety from graduate school stemmed from the feeling of trying incredibly hard and still failing. This made me believe that “my best” was never going to be good enough, and that I might not complete what I had set to achieve in my master’s degree because of my own abilities. \n\nAlthough getting a degree can feel like an endeavor that is meant to be shouldered by one person, it is absolutely not designed to be done alone.\nMy relationship with my master’s degree pivoted when I filled my “failures” with support from the people around me. There were two major steps I took: finding new mentors and changing my relationship with current ones.\n\n\n\nFinding New Mentors\nPersonally, I lacked confidence in discussing and presenting my research to other academics and knew that I needed help preparing for my oral defense. Because I knew my current mentors were extremely busy and could only offer me certan guidance, I attempted to expand my support. I employed the use of community or mosaic mentorship, which is the concept that mentorship should utilize the expertise of many mentors rather than a sole educator. I have written a blog on the impact of mosaic mentorship, which you can find below. \nOne of my professors gave our class the option to present our own research in class without the pressure of receiving a grade. I used it as an opportunity to receive feedback from my professor and my peers, as well as establish a mentor relationship with my professor. If you have similar fears as me, there are also “Grad Slams” on campus where graduate students present their work and receive useful critiques. It is a great opportunity to hear the frequently asked questions that might surface during your presentation.\nWhen picking my committee members for my thesis, which are required for most master degrees, I emphasized early on that I needed support in professional development. My second committee member was able to meet with me once a month to help craft a larger picture of life outside of my master’s. During particularly difficult sections of my program, speaking with my second committee member helped motivate me and reminded me of why I was doing my master’s in the first place. \n\n\n\nChanging relationships with past mentors:\nWhile finding new mentors naturally made sense to me, it was difficult to realize that I was unable to maintain the same relationship with my previous mentors. Expectations of my work had changed, and with that, I needed to reestablish where I and my direct mentor stood.\n\n\nMentorship involves two sides of a professional relationship. As your mentor recognizes new academic potentials within you, you must be able to reflect the same onto your mentor.\nAlthough your mentor can have the best of intentions by entrusting more elaborate work onto you, it is important to understand boundaries and how to assert them. This can help your relationship with your mentor grow as well as maintain a good work-life balance.\nWhat is a boundary? My therapist described a boundary as a statement and an action. A boundary is a statement that defines and protects your integrity. For example, I try to maintain work-life balance by minimizing how much I immediately reply to emails over the weekend. However, boundaries must be “I-centric”, as it defines what you will do if the other person disregards your statement. Thus a boundary is also an action. \n\n\nDefining your boundaries using the “I-centric” model is both empowering and realistic, as you are not telling the other person what to do, rather, what you will do if that boundary is crossed. \nContinuing with my email example, rather than tell my mentor to not email over the weekend, I would inform them of my boundary: I won’t respond to emails over the weekend immediately, it’s best to contact me during the week. It’s to the point, polite, and defines your stance on a topic to your mentor. \nI have found with mentors, students, friends, and family members alike, that undefined boundaries will be continually crossed over and over, many times without knowing the harm it is causing. \nThere may be circumstances where your boundaries will be tested, and in some cases, crossed. It is best to find a mentor who respects your boundaries and does not seek to alter your integrity regularly, whether or not they are doing this intentionally. If you find your mentor continually doing this, restating your boundaries is necessary. \nStating boundaries early in one’s mentorship will help your professional relationship, or in more extreme cases, signal to you that you may need to seek a different mentor. \n\n\n\nIn Summary:\nTrusting another person with your academic and professional journey can be nerve wracking. Vulnerability gives others the ability to criticize you and your work, whether that criticism be hurtful or constructive. \nHowever, creating a plan that fills your academic space with mentors who recognize your vulnerability and choose to uplift you will only enhance your professional journey.\n\n\nTDLR:\n\nRecognizing that expectations placed on you by your mentor, program etc not only require changes within how you work to adapt, but also in your support system\nYou can adapt to handle more responsibilities, but your support and mentorship should equally increase. A mentorship plan will help you achieve this \nA research proposal is different from a mentorship plan  \nAn important aspect of a mentorship plan is receiving guidance from different people for different areas of your growth (Feel free to read my article “Mosaic Mentorship” for more on this) \nAs your academic goals develop, you may need new mentorship or current mentors to change their area of guidance \nVulnerability, at the face of supportive mentors, will help you grow tremendously"

Anything otherwise is a breach of my Academic Integrity and subject to the policies of the University.\n*a) I agree\nb) I disagree\n\nTitle: PCR - Mechanism and Reagents\nPoints: 1\n2. Which of the following describes the mechanism of PCR?\n... PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a method used to amplify specific segments of DNA. It relies on a cycle of denaturation, annealing, and extension. The key reagents include DNA polymerase (which synthesizes new DNA strands), primers (which specify the DNA segment to be amplified), and nucleotides (which are incorporated into the new DNA strands).\na) PCR breaks down proteins.\nb) PCR translates mRNA into protein.\n*c) PCR amplifies specific DNA segments.\nd) PCR transcribes DNA into RNA.\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Expected Results and Troubleshooting\nPoints: 1\n3. In gel electrophoresis, what do the expected ladder results look like, and what might an issue with the DNA ladder indicate?\n... Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size. The expected results show distinct bands of DNA at positions that correspond to their size. The DNA ladder serves as a size marker. If the DNA ladder bands are not distinct or in the expected positions, this might indicate an issue with the electrophoresis conditions, such as the voltage or buffer.\n*a) Expected results show distinct bands of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the electrophoresis conditions.\nb) Expected results show a single band of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the PCR reaction.\nc) Expected results show a gradient of color; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the staining process.\nd) Expected results show no visible bands; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the DNA extraction.\n\nTitle: DNA - Structure and Replication\nPoints: 1\n4. What aspect of DNA is crucial for its replication in PCR and why?\n... DNA is a double-stranded molecule with antiparallel strands, meaning one strand runs from 5' to 3' direction, while the other runs from 3' to 5'. This antiparallel structure is essential for DNA replication because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand, and the process of replication requires a complimentary strand to serve as a template.\n*a) The antiparallel double-stranded structure is crucial because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end.\nb) The helical structure is crucial because it allows the DNA to be unwound for replication by enzymes.\nc) The presence of histone proteins is crucial because they help to package the new DNA strands.\nd) The sequence of the nucleotides is crucial because it determines how negatively charged the DNA is.\n\nTitle: DNA - Complimentary Base Pairing\nPoints: 1\n5. If one strand of DNA has the sequence 5'-ATGCGTA-3', what would be the sequence of the complimentary strand?\n... In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Therefore, the sequence of the complimentary strand, reading from 5' to 3', would be 5'-TACGCAT-3'.\na) 3'-TACGCAT-5'\nb) 5'-ATGCGTA-3'\n*c) 5'-TACGCAT-3'\nd) 5'-CATGCGT-3'\n\nTitle: PCR - Expected Results\nPoints: 1\n6. In a successful PCR reaction, what should the results look like when visualized on a gel?\n... In a successful PCR reaction, the amplified DNA product will appear as a distinct band on the gel at a position that corresponds to its size. The exact position can be determined using a DNA ladder.\n*a) A distinct band at a position that corresponds to the size of the amplified DNA segment.\nb) Multiple bands at various positions.\nc) A gradient of color throughout the gel.\nd) No visible bands.\n\nTitle: PCR - Reagents\nPoints: 1\n7. In a PCR reaction, which of the following reagents are required?\n... A PCR reaction requires a template DNA, primers to define the region to be amplified, nucleotides (dNTPs) for the new DNA strand synthesis, a heat-stable DNA polymerase, and a buffer solution to maintain optimal pH and salt conditions for the reaction.\n[*] Template DNA\n[*] Primers\n[*] dNTPs\n[*] DNA Polymerase\n[ ] RNA Polymerase\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Components\nPoints: 1\n8. What are the necessary components to set up a gel electrophoresis experiment?\n... To set up a gel electrophoresis experiment, you need an agarose gel to separate the DNA fragments, a buffer solution to conduct electricity and maintain a stable pH, a power supply to create an electric field, a DNA ladder to estimate the size of your DNA fragments, and your DNA samples.\n[*] Agarose gel\n[*] Buffer solution\n[*] Power supply\n[*] DNA ladder\n[*] DNA samples\n[ ] dNTPs\n[ ] Primers\n\nTitle: Troubleshooting in PCR\nPoints: 1\n9. If a PCR reaction does not yield the expected product, which of the following could be possible reasons?\n... Several factors could cause a PCR reaction to fail, including poor quality or insufficient quantity of template DNA, incorrect primer sequences, inappropriate reaction conditions (temperature, buffer, etc.), or issues with the DNA polymerase.\n[*] Poor quality or insufficient quantity of template DNA\n[*] Incorrect primer sequences\n[*] Inappropriate reaction conditions\n[ ] Contamination in the DNA ladder\n[*] Issues with the DNA polymerase\n\nTitle: Controls in Experiments\nPoints: 1\n10. Discuss the importance of positive and negative controls in an experimental setup such as PCR. Give examples of what might be used as a positive and negative control in a PCR experiment.\n... Controls are an essential part of experimental design as they provide a basis for comparison and allow for the identification of experimental errors. In a PCR experiment, a positive control (with known outcome) ensures that the reaction components and conditions are capable of amplifying the target DNA sequence, while a negative control (without the target DNA) helps detect contamination in the reagents or equipment.\n_________\n\nTitle: Data Analysis in Biology\nPoints: 1\n11. Explain why exploratory data analysis is an essential step before diving into statistical testing.\n... Exploratory data analysis allows researchers to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, identify outliers and anomalies, and understand underlying patterns. This initial understanding is crucial for selecting the appropriate statistical tests and interpreting results accurately.\n_________ \n\nTitle: Understanding False Positives and Negatives\nPoints: 1\n12. Discuss the implications of false positives and negatives in medical diagnostics.\n... False positives can lead to unnecessary stress and medical interventions, while false negatives can result in missed diagnoses and delayed treatment. Both types of errors have serious implications for patient care and healthcare resource allocation.\n_________ \n\nTitle: Lab Techniques\nPoints: 1\n13.

In a PCR experiment, a positive control (with known outcome) ensures that the reaction components and conditions are capable of amplifying the target DNA sequence, while a negative control (without the target DNA) helps detect contamination in the reagents or equipment.\n_________\n\nTitle: Data Analysis in Biology\nPoints: 1\n11. Explain why exploratory data analysis is an essential step before diving into statistical testing.\n... Exploratory data analysis allows researchers to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, identify outliers and anomalies, and understand underlying patterns. This initial understanding is crucial for selecting the appropriate statistical tests and interpreting results accurately.\n_________ \n\nTitle: Understanding False Positives and Negatives\nPoints: 1\n12. Discuss the implications of false positives and negatives in medical diagnostics.\n... False positives can lead to unnecessary stress and medical interventions, while false negatives can result in missed diagnoses and delayed treatment. Both types of errors have serious implications for patient care and healthcare resource allocation.\n_________ \n\nTitle: Lab Techniques\nPoints: 1\n13. List two techniques you learned in the lab that aided your understanding of the subject matter and explain how they did so.\n... Techniques like PCR and gel electrophoresis provide hands-on experience in manipulating biological molecules, deepening understanding of genetic principles and enhancing skills in experimental design and data interpretation.\n_________ \n\n\n\nOption 3: The no AI option\nIf you already have questions and only need to format them for conversion, you can do the process manually without the use of any gen AI.\nConduct all of your reformatting in a text editor. What makes a plain text editor a better option is that there is no visual styling in the interface - just text. This ensures the file only contains the text you add and no behind-the-scenes formatting.\nUse the style guide found here (the more detailed option). You may also check out the example style I have created below (the simpler option)\n\n\nOPTION 3 STYLE GUIDE\n\n    Questions must follow the style guide provided:\n\n1. Every question should have a title, points value, and an explanation.\n2. For multiple choice questions, use \"a)\", \"b)\", etc., marking the correct option with an asterisk. Randomly vary which option is correct. It should not always be choice \"a)\"\n3. For multiple answer questions, use \"[ ]\" for options and \"[*]\" for correct answers.\n4. Essay questions should end with a new line that includes \"_________\". See examples below.\n5. Begin every feedback with three dots\n6. Questions should only be separated by a line break. Do not add in any extraneous formatting such as \"---\" between questions.\n\nExample format in (generate your response entirely within a code block):\n\nQuiz title: Learning Laboratory Techniques: DNA Extraction, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis\nQuiz description: Review your understanding of DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis.\n\nTitle: Learn with integrity\nPoints: 1\n1. I agree to complete this quiz without the aid of others or AI. I agree not to discuss questions and answers of the quiz until the quiz key is posted. Anything otherwise is a breach of my Academic Integrity and subject to the policies of the University.\n*a) I agree\nb) I disagree\n\nTitle: PCR - Mechanism and Reagents\nPoints: 1\n2. Which of the following describes the mechanism of PCR?\n... PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a method used to amplify specific segments of DNA. It relies on a cycle of denaturation, annealing, and extension. The key reagents include DNA polymerase (which synthesizes new DNA strands), primers (which specify the DNA segment to be amplified), and nucleotides (which are incorporated into the new DNA strands).\na) PCR breaks down proteins.\nb) PCR translates mRNA into protein.\n*c) PCR amplifies specific DNA segments.\nd) PCR transcribes DNA into RNA.\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Expected Results and Troubleshooting\nPoints: 1\n3. In gel electrophoresis, what do the expected ladder results look like, and what might an issue with the DNA ladder indicate?\n... Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size. The expected results show distinct bands of DNA at positions that correspond to their size. The DNA ladder serves as a size marker. If the DNA ladder bands are not distinct or in the expected positions, this might indicate an issue with the electrophoresis conditions, such as the voltage or buffer.\n*a) Expected results show distinct bands of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the electrophoresis conditions.\nb) Expected results show a single band of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the PCR reaction.\nc) Expected results show a gradient of color; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the staining process.\nd) Expected results show no visible bands; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the DNA extraction.\n\nTitle: DNA - Structure and Replication\nPoints: 1\n4. What aspect of DNA is crucial for its replication in PCR and why?\n... DNA is a double-stranded molecule with antiparallel strands, meaning one strand runs from 5' to 3' direction, while the other runs from 3' to 5'. This antiparallel structure is essential for DNA replication because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand, and the process of replication requires a complimentary strand to serve as a template.\n*a) The antiparallel double-stranded structure is crucial because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end.\nb) The helical structure is crucial because it allows the DNA to be unwound for replication by enzymes.\nc) The presence of histone proteins is crucial because they help to package the new DNA strands.\nd) The sequence of the nucleotides is crucial because it determines how negatively charged the DNA is.\n\nTitle: DNA - Complimentary Base Pairing\nPoints: 1\n5. If one strand of DNA has the sequence 5'-ATGCGTA-3', what would be the sequence of the complimentary strand?\n... In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Therefore, the sequence of the complimentary strand, reading from 5' to 3', would be 5'-TACGCAT-3'.\na) 3'-TACGCAT-5'\nb) 5'-ATGCGTA-3'\n*c) 5'-TACGCAT-3'\nd) 5'-CATGCGT-3'\n\nTitle: PCR - Expected Results\nPoints: 1\n6. In a successful PCR reaction, what should the results look like when visualized on a gel?\n... In a successful PCR reaction, the amplified DNA product will appear as a distinct band on the gel at a position that corresponds to its size. The exact position can be determined using a DNA ladder.\n*a) A distinct band at a position that corresponds to the size of the amplified DNA segment.\nb) Multiple bands at various positions.\nc) A gradient of color throughout the gel.\nd) No visible bands.\n\nTitle: PCR - Reagents\nPoints: 1\n7. In a PCR reaction, which of the following reagents are required?\n... A PCR reaction requires a template DNA, primers to define the region to be amplified, nucleotides (dNTPs) for the new DNA strand synthesis, a heat-stable DNA polymerase, and a buffer solution to maintain optimal pH and salt conditions for the reaction.\n[*] Template DNA\n[*] Primers\n[*] dNTPs\n[*] DNA Polymerase\n[ ] RNA Polymerase\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Components\nPoints: 1\n8. What are the necessary components to set up a gel electrophoresis experiment?\n... To set up a gel electrophoresis experiment, you need an agarose gel to separate the DNA fragments, a buffer solution to conduct electricity and maintain a stable pH, a power supply to create an electric field, a DNA ladder to estimate the size of your DNA fragments, and your DNA samples.\n[*] Agarose gel\n[*] Buffer solution\n[*] Power supply\n[*] DNA ladder\n[*] DNA samples\n[ ] dNTPs\n[ ] Primers\n\nTitle: Troubleshooting in PCR\nPoints: 1\n9. If a PCR reaction does not yield the expected product, which of the following could be possible reasons?\n... Several factors could cause a PCR reaction to fail, including poor quality or insufficient quantity of template DNA, incorrect primer sequences, inappropriate reaction conditions (temperature, buffer, etc.), or issues with the DNA polymerase.\n[*] Poor quality or insufficient quantity of template DNA\n[*] Incorrect primer sequences\n[*] Inappropriate reaction conditions\n[ ] Contamination in the DNA ladder\n[*] Issues with the DNA polymerase\n\nTitle: Controls in Experiments\nPoints: 1\n10. Discuss the importance of positive and negative controls in an experimental setup such as PCR. Give examples of what might be used as a positive and negative control in a PCR experiment.\n... Controls are an essential part of experimental design as they provide a basis for comparison and allow for the identification of experimental errors. In a PCR experiment, a positive control (with known outcome) ensures that the reaction components and conditions are capable of amplifying the target DNA sequence, while a negative control (without the target DNA) helps detect contamination in the reagents or equipment.\n_________\n\nTitle: Data Analysis in Biology\nPoints: 1\n11.

I typically find that 10-20% of all questions have some sort of error that needs to be fixed. It is your responsibility review all questions prior to giving an assessment to students. Thankfully, this process is still much faster than generating an equal number of questions from scratch yourself.\n\n\nOnce the questions are generated, copy and paste the results into a text editor to make any fixes or content modifications. Any text editor such as Sublime Text, Notepad++, or whatever came with your computer will suffice.\n\nNote: Be wary of using Microsoft Word or Google Documents. This needs to be a perfectly formatted .txt file and the more complex the software, the more likely it will add extraneous formatting\n\nEdit the document and verify the accuracy and content of the quiz. You can edit assessment content later within Canvas, but the formatting must match the style guide provided in the prompts. A more comprehensive style sheet can be found here if needed.\nYou can also add any of your own original questions to the text file, as long as you format them properly.\nSave the document as a “.txt” file.
