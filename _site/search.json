    "text": "Figuring it out by messing it all up\nIn my third year at UCSD, I was thrilled to have found a professor who 1) embodied my interest in merging science and writing and 2) had genuine enthusiasm in my professional development. With the right program, he encouraged me that he would be able to support my independent research ventures. The TRELS program at UCSD was the perfect platform for me to both explore the communication of climate change and completely botch my mentorship with my professor.\nAlthough this was not my intention, the experience taught me an important lesson that I wished I understood earlier during my time at UCSD.\nHow exactly did I achieve this? The Triton Research & Experiential Learning Scholars (TRELS) program was the first platform I had been granted to express and develop my academic interests with a professor. I immediately poured all parts of myself into this project and, in doing so, asked for multiple layers of mentorship from a sole educator.\nI wanted to explore human language, to understand how the structure of words in a sentence could have an impact on how we perceive and make decisions about climate change. I wished to investigate decades of discussions surrounding global warming and how this history perpetuates misinformation we still see today. I sought to labor through dense climate reports and reference the well researched biology, chemistry, and physics that already existed.\nAnd beyond my research paper, I had an innate desire to understand who exactly I was becoming in my journey of personal and professional development. While I rejected it at the time, my identity was intricately woven between my interests.\nIt was only after I told this story to another professor of mine did the reality of my “plan” of mentorship come crashing down. No one person would be able to appeal to all the facets of my interests and needs in my academic development. I needed a linguist, a historian, and a climate scientist at least to aid me in my research goal, and instead, I had brought these expectations into my mentorship with my professor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll admit I’m being a little hard on my third-year self, as the pursuit for mentorship is self-motivated on a large public campus such as UCSD.\nUniversity is many students’ first opportunity to dictate their education. Many students are coming from high school where education is driven by obligation, and most classes, teachers, and times of instruction are assigned with little student input. Upon entering UCSD, I found myself in control of my chosen degree with the exception of a few administrative nudges in the right direction in order to graduate on time. The void of academic constraint was suddenly overflowing with choices I had to make, and after planning out the first few quarters at UCSD, I was satiated with my own involvement in my undergraduate degree. Directing my own mentorship, which would include the close involvement of PhD-holding professors, was completely absent from my mind.\n\nHowever, as I became more comfortable with the campus, I realized that there was an unavoidably large piece of my education missing with the lack of mentorship.\nBy my third year, when I had finally found a professor who acknowledged my interests as something worth investing in, I didn’t know how to ask for what I needed. After months of searching for a professor to represent me and my academic growth, I came into my mentorship starstruck and unable to use critical thinking. I was looking for too much guidance in too many places, all the while not really knowing what I was looking for.\nLuckily, upon reflection, this problem has a dynamic solution."

    "section": "Mosaic mentorship",
    "text": "Mosaic mentorship\nWhat I needed in the past was a community of mentors full of niche, yet separate, roles in my progression of research and sense of self as an academic. While relatively new, the concept of community or “mosaic” mentorship, or the incorporation of an array of diverse mentors into a student’s professional growth, has been thought to better aid mentees (Khatchikian, Chahal, and Kielar, 2021).\nI was able to experience the benefits of mosaic mentorship firsthand, as I incorporated a community of mentors into my master’s program. A master’s in biology at UCSD includes performing two years of lab research under the guidance of a Principal Investigator (PI) and synthesizing your findings into a written and oral thesis. In addition to your PI, you need at least two more UCSD professionals or thesis committee members in order to complete your master’s. While my PI aided me in my direct research, my committee members gave me a wide perspective of the field and how to effectively communicate science.\nAdditionally, having two, three, four perspectives on a collection of topics allowed me to critically think about my lab PI’s advice and guidance.\n\nWhile a professor’s opinion may be trying to steer you in the right direction for their profession, this may not actually be where you are wanting to take your development. Rather than become a parrot of your mentor’s advice, with mosaic mentorship you are able to synthesize collective thought to become the researcher you are aiming to be.\nMosaic mentorship also benefits your mentor too. All professors at UCSD do work outside of the classroom and most likely cannot offer you the complete mentorship you are looking for, even if they are enthusiastic about working with you. Mosaic mentorship respects the time of your mentors by dividing up the amount of mentorship you need to succeed.\nMentorship completely enlivened my experience at UCSD. Learning facts about biology was what I came to UCSD to do, but becoming scientifically literate and fostering my own sense of professional identity was the most important part of the process. And this is not only true for me– it has been shown that students mentored in academia tended to self-identify as a scientist more than those without a mentor (Atkins et al., 2020). It is difficult to feel a part of the academic community without a group of people there to champion and advocate for you.\nUniversity is a place to find inspiration for your academic goals, but it is ultimately up to you to invest in your interests. I was never taught how to effectively pursue mentorship, and it took a few mistakes to finalize what I needed. You will most likely continue to make mistakes along your mentorship journey, but I can assure you that it will be worth it."

It is designed to introduce you to the fields of evolution, systematics, ecology, environmental science, behavior and conservation biology. The major focus of the course will be on evolution, since an understanding of the evolutionary process enables us to grasp why there are so many different kinds of living things, how they interact with each other to produce complex ecosystems, the ways in which these interactions may lead to the evolution of complex behaviors, how evolution has often brought about large changes in body plan, and how species (including ourselves) are likely to continue to evolve. Such knowledge is essential for understanding biology in general, and provides the tools for our stewardship of the planet’s biota and the sustainability of the ecological services we take for granted."

Similar to many other research-based MS programs, I submitted a research proposal during my application process. A research proposal outlines what types of experiments you will be conducting in order to answer a set of scientific questions, and how you might achieve these goals throughout your academic timeline. While it is easy for you to think your research proposal encompasses your mentorship plan, this is not the case. \nA mentorship plan recognizes the mentors that you currently have (professors, postdocs, TAs, peers etc) and what they are capable of assisting you with. From there, you may notice the gaps of support where you need it most. Much of my own anxiety from graduate school stemmed from the feeling of trying incredibly hard and still failing. This made me believe that “my best” was never going to be good enough, and that I might not complete what I had set to achieve in my master’s degree because of my own abilities. \n\nAlthough getting a degree can feel like an endeavor that is meant to be shouldered by one person, it is absolutely not designed to be done alone.\nMy relationship with my master’s degree pivoted when I filled my “failures” with support from the people around me.

    "text": "Incorporating a Mentorship Plan into Your Degree\nIt wasn’t until halfway through my master’s program at UC San Diego did I realize I needed to create an adaptive mentorship plan. In order to graduate and feel confident going into the working world outside of my master’s, I needed to receive extra support. \nI was in the expedited BS/MS program, which combined a year’s worth of research at a lab on campus in my BS with another year’s worth of research in my MS. Because it was a degree in biology, this meant that my research would culminate in a final written and oral thesis defense. \nI had comfortably stayed at my undergraduate lab for my master’s, and while my location did not change, the expectation for my work had. \nThe next year of my master’s was going to be rigorous, as my experiments were longer and required more attention, and I was a bit terrified to present my research among academics. My postdoctoral mentor had also recently left the lab and with that my primary person for direct technical guidance and career advice was no longer as easily accessible. \nIt was hard to admit at the time, but I was treading in deep, deep water. I was unsure how to navigate this all with less support than I had before. \n\nBecause of my experiences with mentorship in the past, I recognized that I needed extended support and some clarity within the mentorship I already had.\n\nIf you are asked to tackle larger responsibilities and your abilities are stretched thin, your support system will need to step up.\nAnd because everyone is busy and has many responsibilities of their own, the only person that can catalyze this is you. Rather than expend your energy trying to cover all your bases, an investment into a mentorship plan will help tremendously. \n\n\nHow does one successfully create a mentorship plan?\nFirstly, it is important to differentiate a research plan from a mentorship plan.

For this reason, we converted our face-to-face molecular biology lab course to an online version in Spring 2020. The lab course focuses on using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to introduce mutations into the ADE2 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When planning the conversion to online, we identified a number of challenges to addressing the course goals, such as including technology, accessing real data for analysis, and engaging students in collaboration. After brainstorming ways to address these and other challenges, we developed an online lab course for which the “in lab” portion was largely focused on working collaboratively on data analysis, troubleshooting, and drawing conclusions, as well as experimental design and examining primary literature. Surveys suggest students perceived significant gains in key scientific thinking and process skills including forming scientific arguments, data analysis, and working collaboratively. Students also reported multiple different ways in which the online courses made them feel like scientists. Here we describe key parts of the course structure and our experience in teaching the course to over 200 students. We also describe the process of converting from face-to-face to online, as the process could be applied to any existing hands-on lab. The process enabled us to quickly adapt important information, course goals, and experimental contexts from existing labs, reducing the workload involved in creating a new lab while still providing the experience of focusing on scientific thinking skills to students."

    "text": "Assessing outcomes of science process learning in early undergraduate education\nHistorically, university biology programs have rarely incorporated courses explicitly focused on science process skills into their introductory course series. However, information literacy, experimental design, and data analysis are foundational skills for professional scientists. Developing that toolkit early may be integral to undergraduate learners identifying as biologists and persisting in the field. Data Analysis and Design for Biologists (BILD 5; 4 units) was piloted in the winter of 2022 at U.C. San Diego to help fill that role. This course is a practical introduction to core science process skills. Additionally, students are introduced to coding, data management, and quantitative analysis using the R programming language. Students learn how to evaluate scientific information, design experiments, manage data, and analyze it statistically. \nA central part of the course is a term project in which students complete their own investigative cycle from start to finish. A series of checkpoints provide formative feedback as they ask a biological question, design an experiment, create an analytical plan, and then receive simulated data for analysis in their final summative assessment. Course lecture topics mirror this investigative cycle, allowing them to slowly develop these skills in the class through small group work, practice exercises, and other active learning exercises. We assessed learning gains by utilizing a pre and post concept inventory (adapted from the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS) mapped to our course learning objectives. For most course objectives there was an increase in the number of correctly answered questions on the post-course concept inventory. Our attitudes survey was adapted from multiple sources, such as the Student Course Engagement Questionnaire (SCEQ) and the Biggs Study Process Questionnaire.\nSignificant gains were made in multiple areas, including student perception of their ability to read and understand primary literature and experience carrying out a research project entirely of student design. Based on this analysis, early, explicit instruction in science process skills is valuable, both to students’ learning and their perception of themselves as independent scientists and thinkers. In the future, we hope to continue to monitor student success downstream to see the long-range impact of this course."

    "text": "Best Practices in Course-based Undergradate Research Experiences (CUREs)\nCUREs bring research into the classroom. Students learn by participating in a research project that may use their collected and analyzed data to address a question important to the larger scientific community. This may include contributing to peer-reviewed publications, white papers, online databases, etc. Students can claim ownership of a legitimate scientific product, thereby helping them gain confidence in their identity as a scientist.\nHowever, CURE data is often problematic. Students by nature are novices, making data quality a serious issue. Additionally, sampling is often structured to fit into a quarterly or semester schedule, repeated throughout the year, which potentially leads to significant pseudoreplication and diminished statistical power. Most importantly, the primary goals of teaching and experimentation are different and sometime challenging to align.\nOur research uses data collected from CUREs run in undergraduate lab courses to test various methods to address these issues. Currently, we are drafting best practices for data validation and the handling of missing and outlier data."
