    "text": "Figuring it out by messing it all up\nIn my third year at UCSD, I was thrilled to have found a professor who 1) embodied my interest in merging science and writing and 2) had genuine enthusiasm in my professional development. With the right program, he encouraged me that he would be able to support my independent research ventures. The TRELS program at UCSD was the perfect platform for me to both explore the communication of climate change and completely botch my mentorship with my professor.\nAlthough this was not my intention, the experience taught me an important lesson that I wished I understood earlier during my time at UCSD.\nHow exactly did I achieve this? The Triton Research & Experiential Learning Scholars (TRELS) program was the first platform I had been granted to express and develop my academic interests with a professor. I immediately poured all parts of myself into this project and, in doing so, asked for multiple layers of mentorship from a sole educator.\nI wanted to explore human language, to understand how the structure of words in a sentence could have an impact on how we perceive and make decisions about climate change. I wished to investigate decades of discussions surrounding global warming and how this history perpetuates misinformation we still see today. I sought to labor through dense climate reports and reference the well researched biology, chemistry, and physics that already existed.\nAnd beyond my research paper, I had an innate desire to understand who exactly I was becoming in my journey of personal and professional development. While I rejected it at the time, my identity was intricately woven between my interests.\nIt was only after I told this story to another professor of mine did the reality of my “plan” of mentorship come crashing down. No one person would be able to appeal to all the facets of my interests and needs in my academic development. I needed a linguist, a historian, and a climate scientist at least to aid me in my research goal, and instead, I had brought these expectations into my mentorship with my professor.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll admit I’m being a little hard on my third-year self, as the pursuit for mentorship is self-motivated on a large public campus such as UCSD.\nUniversity is many students’ first opportunity to dictate their education. Many students are coming from high school where education is driven by obligation, and most classes, teachers, and times of instruction are assigned with little student input. Upon entering UCSD, I found myself in control of my chosen degree with the exception of a few administrative nudges in the right direction in order to graduate on time. The void of academic constraint was suddenly overflowing with choices I had to make, and after planning out the first few quarters at UCSD, I was satiated with my own involvement in my undergraduate degree. Directing my own mentorship, which would include the close involvement of PhD-holding professors, was completely absent from my mind.\n\nHowever, as I became more comfortable with the campus, I realized that there was an unavoidably large piece of my education missing with the lack of mentorship.\nBy my third year, when I had finally found a professor who acknowledged my interests as something worth investing in, I didn’t know how to ask for what I needed. After months of searching for a professor to represent me and my academic growth, I came into my mentorship starstruck and unable to use critical thinking. I was looking for too much guidance in too many places, all the while not really knowing what I was looking for.\nLuckily, upon reflection, this problem has a dynamic solution."

    "text": "Mosaic mentorship\nWhat I needed in the past was a community of mentors full of niche, yet separate, roles in my progression of research and sense of self as an academic. While relatively new, the concept of community or “mosaic” mentorship, or the incorporation of an array of diverse mentors into a student’s professional growth, has been thought to better aid mentees (Khatchikian, Chahal, and Kielar, 2021).\nI was able to experience the benefits of mosaic mentorship firsthand, as I incorporated a community of mentors into my master’s program. A master’s in biology at UCSD includes performing two years of lab research under the guidance of a Principal Investigator (PI) and synthesizing your findings into a written and oral thesis. In addition to your PI, you need at least two more UCSD professionals or thesis committee members in order to complete your master’s. While my PI aided me in my direct research, my committee members gave me a wide perspective of the field and how to effectively communicate science.\nAdditionally, having two, three, four perspectives on a collection of topics allowed me to critically think about my lab PI’s advice and guidance.\n\nWhile a professor’s opinion may be trying to steer you in the right direction for their profession, this may not actually be where you are wanting to take your development. Rather than become a parrot of your mentor’s advice, with mosaic mentorship you are able to synthesize collective thought to become the researcher you are aiming to be.\nMosaic mentorship also benefits your mentor too. All professors at UCSD do work outside of the classroom and most likely cannot offer you the complete mentorship you are looking for, even if they are enthusiastic about working with you. Mosaic mentorship respects the time of your mentors by dividing up the amount of mentorship you need to succeed.\nMentorship completely enlivened my experience at UCSD. Learning facts about biology was what I came to UCSD to do, but becoming scientifically literate and fostering my own sense of professional identity was the most important part of the process. And this is not only true for me– it has been shown that students mentored in academia tended to self-identify as a scientist more than those without a mentor (Atkins et al., 2020). It is difficult to feel a part of the academic community without a group of people there to champion and advocate for you.\nUniversity is a place to find inspiration for your academic goals, but it is ultimately up to you to invest in your interests. I was never taught how to effectively pursue mentorship, and it took a few mistakes to finalize what I needed. You will most likely continue to make mistakes along your mentorship journey, but I can assure you that it will be worth it."

The major focus of the course will be on evolution, since an understanding of the evolutionary process enables us to grasp why there are so many different kinds of living things, how they interact with each other to produce complex ecosystems, the ways in which these interactions may lead to the evolution of complex behaviors, how evolution has often brought about large changes in body plan, and how species (including ourselves) are likely to continue to evolve. Such knowledge is essential for understanding biology in general, and provides the tools for our stewardship of the planet’s biota and the sustainability of the ecological services we take for granted."

Similar to many other research-based MS programs, I submitted a research proposal during my application process. A research proposal outlines what types of experiments you will be conducting in order to answer a set of scientific questions, and how you might achieve these goals throughout your academic timeline. While it is easy for you to think your research proposal encompasses your mentorship plan, this is not the case. \nA mentorship plan recognizes the mentors that you currently have (professors, postdocs, TAs, peers etc) and what they are capable of assisting you with. From there, you may notice the gaps of support where you need it most. Much of my own anxiety from graduate school stemmed from the feeling of trying incredibly hard and still failing.

    "text": "Incorporating a Mentorship Plan into Your Degree\nIt wasn’t until halfway through my master’s program at UC San Diego did I realize I needed to create an adaptive mentorship plan. In order to graduate and feel confident going into the working world outside of my master’s, I needed to receive extra support. \nI was in the expedited BS/MS program, which combined a year’s worth of research at a lab on campus in my BS with another year’s worth of research in my MS. Because it was a degree in biology, this meant that my research would culminate in a final written and oral thesis defense. \nI had comfortably stayed at my undergraduate lab for my master’s, and while my location did not change, the expectation for my work had. \nThe next year of my master’s was going to be rigorous, as my experiments were longer and required more attention, and I was a bit terrified to present my research among academics. My postdoctoral mentor had also recently left the lab and with that my primary person for direct technical guidance and career advice was no longer as easily accessible. \nIt was hard to admit at the time, but I was treading in deep, deep water. I was unsure how to navigate this all with less support than I had before. \n\nBecause of my experiences with mentorship in the past, I recognized that I needed extended support and some clarity within the mentorship I already had.\n\nIf you are asked to tackle larger responsibilities and your abilities are stretched thin, your support system will need to step up.\nAnd because everyone is busy and has many responsibilities of their own, the only person that can catalyze this is you. Rather than expend your energy trying to cover all your bases, an investment into a mentorship plan will help tremendously. \n\n\nHow does one successfully create a mentorship plan?\nFirstly, it is important to differentiate a research plan from a mentorship plan.

    "text": "Link the to CourseSource paper\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a need to convert in-person laboratory courses into an online format in a short amount of time. For this reason, we converted our face-to-face molecular biology lab course to an online version in Spring 2020. The lab course focuses on using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to introduce mutations into the ADE2 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When planning the conversion to online, we identified a number of challenges to addressing the course goals, such as including technology, accessing real data for analysis, and engaging students in collaboration. After brainstorming ways to address these and other challenges, we developed an online lab course for which the “in lab” portion was largely focused on working collaboratively on data analysis, troubleshooting, and drawing conclusions, as well as experimental design and examining primary literature. Surveys suggest students perceived significant gains in key scientific thinking and process skills including forming scientific arguments, data analysis, and working collaboratively. Students also reported multiple different ways in which the online courses made them feel like scientists. Here we describe key parts of the course structure and our experience in teaching the course to over 200 students. We also describe the process of converting from face-to-face to online, as the process could be applied to any existing hands-on lab. The process enabled us to quickly adapt important information, course goals, and experimental contexts from existing labs, reducing the workload involved in creating a new lab while still providing the experience of focusing on scientific thinking skills to students."

    "text": "Assessing outcomes of science process learning in early undergraduate education\nHistorically, university biology programs have rarely incorporated courses explicitly focused on science process skills into their introductory course series. However, information literacy, experimental design, and data analysis are foundational skills for professional scientists. Developing that toolkit early may be integral to undergraduate learners identifying as biologists and persisting in the field. Data Analysis and Design for Biologists (BILD 5; 4 units) was piloted in the winter of 2022 at U.C. San Diego to help fill that role. This course is a practical introduction to core science process skills. Additionally, students are introduced to coding, data management, and quantitative analysis using the R programming language. Students learn how to evaluate scientific information, design experiments, manage data, and analyze it statistically. \nA central part of the course is a term project in which students complete their own investigative cycle from start to finish. A series of checkpoints provide formative feedback as they ask a biological question, design an experiment, create an analytical plan, and then receive simulated data for analysis in their final summative assessment. Course lecture topics mirror this investigative cycle, allowing them to slowly develop these skills in the class through small group work, practice exercises, and other active learning exercises. We assessed learning gains by utilizing a pre and post concept inventory (adapted from the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS) mapped to our course learning objectives. For most course objectives there was an increase in the number of correctly answered questions on the post-course concept inventory. Our attitudes survey was adapted from multiple sources, such as the Student Course Engagement Questionnaire (SCEQ) and the Biggs Study Process Questionnaire.\nSignificant gains were made in multiple areas, including student perception of their ability to read and understand primary literature and experience carrying out a research project entirely of student design. Based on this analysis, early, explicit instruction in science process skills is valuable, both to students’ learning and their perception of themselves as independent scientists and thinkers. In the future, we hope to continue to monitor student success downstream to see the long-range impact of this course."

Students learn by participating in a research project that may use their collected and analyzed data to address a question important to the larger scientific community. This may include contributing to peer-reviewed publications, white papers, online databases, etc. Students can claim ownership of a legitimate scientific product, thereby helping them gain confidence in their identity as a scientist.\nHowever, CURE data is often problematic. Students by nature are novices, making data quality a serious issue. Additionally, sampling is often structured to fit into a quarterly or semester schedule, repeated throughout the year, which potentially leads to significant pseudoreplication and diminished statistical power. Most importantly, the primary goals of teaching and experimentation are different and sometime challenging to align.\nOur research uses data collected from CUREs run in undergraduate lab courses to test various methods to address these issues.

The free 3.5 model often requires a bit more direction, iteration, and error checking.\nClaudeAI is a free option that is getting increasingly impressive for a free service. I find it to work well for this project.\n\n\n\nUsing the Prompt:\n\nProvide gen AI with the prompt designed to generate questions for an undergraduate biology quiz properly formatted for conversion to Canvas’s QTI.zip file format (See the optimized prompts provided for reference.)\nOption 1 is if you already have assessment questions and need them formatted for upload to Canvas. Copy and paste (and edit as needed) the prompt below into a gen AI chat.\nOption 2 is if you also want gen AI to generate questions for you. Copy and paste (and edit as needed) the prompt below into a gen AI chat.\n\n\nOPTION 2 PROMPT\n\nDesign a compelling online quiz tailored for an undergraduate biology course, emphasizing higher-order cognitive skills based on Bloom's taxonomy. The quiz should comprise:\n- 10 multiple choice questions\n- 10 multiple answer questions\n- 5 applied or conceptual essay questions \n\nEach question carries a point value of 1. Ensure questions are not based on mere factual recall. Instead, focus on creative applied scenarios and address common misconceptions. Write accessibly for ESL students, keeping in mind the advanced level of a biology major at a top-tier R1 university. \n\nYour first response should request a list of topics from me in the form of a list.\n\nQuestions must follow the style guide provided:\n\n1. Use format encapsulated within a code block.\n2. Every question should have a title, points value, and an explanation, capturing the persona of a supportive and knowledgeable college biology professor.\n3. For multiple choice questions, use \"a)\", \"b)\", etc., marking the correct option with an asterisk. Randomly vary which option is correct. It should not always be choice \"a)\"\n4. For multiple answer questions, use \"[ ]\" for options and \"[*]\" for correct answers.\n5. Essay questions should end with a new line that includes \"_________\". See examples below.\n6. Begin every feedback with three dots\n7. Questions should only be separated by a line break. Do not add in any extraneous formatting such as \"---\" between questions.\n\nThe quiz's first question should always uphold academic integrity, as shown in the example below.\n\n\nExample format in (generate your response entirely within a code block):\n\nQuiz title: Learning Laboratory Techniques: DNA Extraction, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis\nQuiz description: Review your understanding of DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis.\n\nTitle: Learn with integrity\nPoints: 1\n1. I agree to complete this quiz without the aid of others or AI. I agree not to discuss questions and answers of the quiz until the quiz key is posted. Anything otherwise is a breach of my Academic Integrity and subject to the policies of the University.\n*a) I agree\nb) I disagree\n\nTitle: PCR - Mechanism and Reagents\nPoints: 1\n2. Which of the following describes the mechanism of PCR?\n... PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a method used to amplify specific segments of DNA. It relies on a cycle of denaturation, annealing, and extension. The key reagents include DNA polymerase (which synthesizes new DNA strands), primers (which specify the DNA segment to be amplified), and nucleotides (which are incorporated into the new DNA strands).\na) PCR breaks down proteins.\nb) PCR translates mRNA into protein.\n*c) PCR amplifies specific DNA segments.\nd) PCR transcribes DNA into RNA.\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Expected Results and Troubleshooting\nPoints: 1\n3. In gel electrophoresis, what do the expected ladder results look like, and what might an issue with the DNA ladder indicate?\n... Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size. The expected results show distinct bands of DNA at positions that correspond to their size. The DNA ladder serves as a size marker. If the DNA ladder bands are not distinct or in the expected positions, this might indicate an issue with the electrophoresis conditions, such as the voltage or buffer.\n*a) Expected results show distinct bands of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the electrophoresis conditions.\nb) Expected results show a single band of DNA; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the PCR reaction.\nc) Expected results show a gradient of color; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the staining process.\nd) Expected results show no visible bands; an issue with the DNA ladder might indicate a problem with the DNA extraction.\n\nTitle: DNA - Structure and Replication\nPoints: 1\n4. What aspect of DNA is crucial for its replication in PCR and why?\n... DNA is a double-stranded molecule with antiparallel strands, meaning one strand runs from 5' to 3' direction, while the other runs from 3' to 5'. This antiparallel structure is essential for DNA replication because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand, and the process of replication requires a complimentary strand to serve as a template.\n*a) The antiparallel double-stranded structure is crucial because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end.\nb) The helical structure is crucial because it allows the DNA to be unwound for replication by enzymes.\nc) The presence of histone proteins is crucial because they help to package the new DNA strands.\nd) The sequence of the nucleotides is crucial because it determines how negatively charged the DNA is.\n\nTitle: DNA - Complimentary Base Pairing\nPoints: 1\n5. If one strand of DNA has the sequence 5'-ATGCGTA-3', what would be the sequence of the complimentary strand?\n... In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Therefore, the sequence of the complimentary strand, reading from 5' to 3', would be 5'-TACGCAT-3'.\na) 3'-TACGCAT-5'\nb) 5'-ATGCGTA-3'\n*c) 5'-TACGCAT-3'\nd) 5'-CATGCGT-3'\n\nTitle: PCR - Expected Results\nPoints: 1\n6. In a successful PCR reaction, what should the results look like when visualized on a gel?\n... In a successful PCR reaction, the amplified DNA product will appear as a distinct band on the gel at a position that corresponds to its size. The exact position can be determined using a DNA ladder.\n*a) A distinct band at a position that corresponds to the size of the amplified DNA segment.\nb) Multiple bands at various positions.\nc) A gradient of color throughout the gel.\nd) No visible bands.\n\nTitle: PCR - Reagents\nPoints: 1\n7. In a PCR reaction, which of the following reagents are required?\n... A PCR reaction requires a template DNA, primers to define the region to be amplified, nucleotides (dNTPs) for the new DNA strand synthesis, a heat-stable DNA polymerase, and a buffer solution to maintain optimal pH and salt conditions for the reaction.\n[*] Template DNA\n[*] Primers\n[*] dNTPs\n[*] DNA Polymerase\n[ ] RNA Polymerase\n\nTitle: Gel Electrophoresis - Components\nPoints: 1\n8. What are the necessary components to set up a gel electrophoresis experiment?\n... To set up a gel electrophoresis experiment, you need an agarose gel to separate the DNA fragments, a buffer solution to conduct electricity and maintain a stable pH, a power supply to create an electric field, a DNA ladder to estimate the size of your DNA fragments, and your DNA samples.\n[*] Agarose gel\n[*] Buffer solution\n[*] Power supply\n[*] DNA ladder\n[*] DNA samples\n[ ] dNTPs\n[ ] Primers\n\nTitle: Troubleshooting in PCR\nPoints: 1\n9. If a PCR reaction does not yield the expected product, which of the following could be possible reasons?\n... Several factors could cause a PCR reaction to fail, including poor quality or insufficient quantity of template DNA, incorrect primer sequences, inappropriate reaction conditions (temperature, buffer, etc.), or issues with the DNA polymerase.\n[*] Poor quality or insufficient quantity of template DNA\n[*] Incorrect primer sequences\n[*] Inappropriate reaction conditions\n[ ] Contamination in the DNA ladder\n[*] Issues with the DNA polymerase\n\nTitle: Controls in Experiments\nPoints: 1\n10. Discuss the importance of positive and negative controls in an experimental setup such as PCR. Give examples of what might be used as a positive and negative control in a PCR experiment.\n... Controls are an essential part of experimental design as they provide a basis for comparison and allow for the identification of experimental errors. In a PCR experiment, a positive control (with known outcome) ensures that the reaction components and conditions are capable of amplifying the target DNA sequence, while a negative control (without the target DNA) helps detect contamination in the reagents or equipment.\n_________\n\nTitle: Data Analysis in Biology\nPoints: 1\n11. Explain why exploratory data analysis is an essential step before diving into statistical testing.\n... Exploratory data analysis allows researchers to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, identify outliers and anomalies, and understand underlying patterns. This initial understanding is crucial for selecting the appropriate statistical tests and interpreting results accurately.\n_________ \n\nTitle: Understanding False Positives and Negatives\nPoints: 1\n12. Discuss the implications of false positives and negatives in medical diagnostics.\n... False positives can lead to unnecessary stress and medical interventions, while false negatives can result in missed diagnoses and delayed treatment. Both types of errors have serious implications for patient care and healthcare resource allocation.\n_________ \n\nTitle: Lab Techniques\nPoints: 1\n13. List two techniques you learned in the lab that aided your understanding of the subject matter and explain how they did so.\n... Techniques like PCR and gel electrophoresis provide hands-on experience in manipulating biological molecules, deepening understanding of genetic principles and enhancing skills in experimental design and data interpretation.\n_________ \n\nValidating and Refining: Once the questions are generated, copy and paste the results into a text editor to make any fixes or content modifications.\n\n\n\nConverting Questions to qti.zip Format using Streamlit App\n\nIntroduction to the Streamlit App: This app, based on the text2qti library, will convert the markdown formatted questions into a qti.zip file compatible with Canvas LMS.\nInputting Questions: Copy and paste your questions into the app.\nGenerating qti.zip File: Follow the app’s instructions to generate the file.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Streamlit App Interface\n\n\nLink to the Streamlit App\n\n\nUploading the qti.zip File to Canvas LMS\n\nLog in to your Canvas LMS account.\nNavigate to the course where you want to upload the quiz.\nGo to the ‘Quizzes’ section and select ‘Import’.\nChoose the qti.zip file and upload.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Canvas LMS Upload Interface"

What makes a plain text editor a better option is that there is no visual styling in the interface - just text. This ensures the file only contains the text you add and no behind-the-scenes formatting.\nUse the style guide found here (the more detailed option). You may also check out the example style I have created below (the simpler option)\n\n\nOPTION 3 STYLE GUIDE\n\n    Questions must follow the style guide provided:\n\n1. Every question should have a title, points value, and an explanation.\n2. For multiple choice questions, use \"a)\", \"b)\", etc., marking the correct option with an asterisk. Randomly vary which option is correct. It should not always be choice \"a)\"\n3. For multiple answer questions, use \"[ ]\" for options and \"[*]\" for correct answers.\n4. Essay questions should end with a new line that includes \"_________\". See examples below.\n5. Begin every feedback with three dots\n6. Questions should only be separated by a line break. Do not add in any extraneous formatting such as \"---\" between questions.\n\nExample format in (generate your response entirely within a code block):\n\nQuiz title: Learning Laboratory Techniques: DNA Extraction, PCR, and Gel Electrophoresis\nQuiz description: Review your understanding of DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis.\n\nTitle: Learn with integrity\nPoints: 1\n1.

To encourage collaboration and community building, many class and laboratory activities and assignments will be done in teams, and grades will not be assigned on a curve. Instead of memorization, we will focus on developing an understanding of fundamental concepts and laboratory skills as they apply to different examples and learn to draw conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. We will utilize class and laboratory time to construct and apply our knowledge, troubleshoot challenging topics, practice problem solving, and develop skills in critical thinking.
