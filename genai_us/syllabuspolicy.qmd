## My personal GenAI policy template

\

> ### Academic Integrity Policy on the Use of Generative AI
>
> ***TLDR: Generative AI is transformative for the workplace and beyond. I encourage you to embrace it, but use it wisely and ethically.***
>
> #### Philosophical Overview
>
> Generative AI is neutral by nature, neither good nor bad. Its value hinges on how it's applied. We acknowledge AI's potential to both elevate and diminish the academic experience. While it's a powerful tool for the digital age and essential for our future, it doesn't absolve us from upholding academic integrity and opposing plagiarism.
>
> #### Personal Responsibility and Accountability
>
> You own your work. AI can assist, but it shouldn't be the main contributor. If your work appears overly dependent on AI, expect an oral quiz to test your understanding. Remember: mastering AI, like any skill, takes effort. Over-relying on it shortchanges your education and has lasting consequences.\
>
> #### Attribution and Documentation
>
> Using AI-generated content? Document:
>
> -   Prompts given to the AI: "\<List prompt(s)\>"
> -   AI's direct output: "<Paste the output generated by the AI system>"
> -   Your modifications to the output: "<explain the actions taken>"
> -   How did you verify the information? Did you run the code or did you have to fact-check online?
>
> Include this documentation in your references/citations. It won't impact word or page limits.
>
> **Example:**
>
> -   Prompt for ChatGPT: "Discuss the impact of climate change on marine biodiversity."
> -   AI's output: "Climate change has led to ocean acidification, causing coral bleaching and marine species decline."
> -   My modifications: Added recent stats and specific species examples and I fact-checked the gen AI claims at: [How does climate change affect coral reefs?](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coralreef-climate.html)\
>
> #### Disclaimer on Generative AI
>
> Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, can sometimes produce misleading or false information. You're accountable for every submission, AI-assisted or not. ALWAYS fact-check AI-generated content before submission.
