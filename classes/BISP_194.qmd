# BISP 194 - COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines

## Course Description:

Since the initial spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19, we have witnessed the rapid development, testing, and dissemination of mRNA vaccines. In this seminar, we'll discuss several aspects of the vaccination approval pipeline from discovery to testing for safety and efficacy. While we will discuss biological mechanisms, the primary focus of this course will be in experimental design and drawing conclusions from data. In the usual seminar format, one or more people speak on a selected topic, and then there is a period for discussion of the topic. This course will give you practice using primary literature to learn about a topic, communicate that knowledge to others, and lead a discussion among your peers.
